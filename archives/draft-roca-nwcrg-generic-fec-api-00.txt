 Generic Application Programming Interface (API) for Window-Based Codes
                  draft-roca-nwcrg-generic-fec-api-00

Abstract

   This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface
   (API) for window-based FEC codes.  This API is meant to be usable by
   any sliding window FEC code, independently of the FEC Scheme or
   network coding protocol that may rely on it.  This API defines the
   core procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e.,
   implementation of the FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer
   aspects (e.g., signalling) that are the responsibility of the
   application making use of the codec.  A goal of this document is to
   pave the way for a future open-source implementation of such codes.

1.  Introduction

   This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface
   (API) for window-based FEC codes.  This API is meant to be usable by
   any window-based FEC code, independently of the FEC Scheme or network
   coding protocol that may rely on it.  This API defines the core
   procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e.,
   implementation of the FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer
   aspects (e.g., signalling) that are the responsibility of the
   application making use of the codec.

   A goal of this document is to pave the way for a future open-source
   implementation of such codes.

   This API must be compatible with:

   o  MDS and non-MDS codes;
   o  Fixed rate and rateless codes;
   o  Codes restricted to end-to-end use-cases as well as codes
      compatible with in-network re-encoding use-cases;

   Since this is a usage consideration, this API is not impacted by the
   intra-flow versus inter-flow nature of the use-case, nor is it
   impacted by the single-path versus multi-paths nature of the use-
   case.

   Last but not least, having a common generic API is future-proof.
   Whatever may appear in the future can be more easily integrated into
   existing software thanks to a common API.

   A few words about block FEC codes and why we do not try to encompass
   them in this API...

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   various proposals in order to be able to compare and agree on what
   should be done.

3.3.  Cedric API proposal

   For DRAGONCAST/DragonNet/GardiNet:

   o  an API could be globally pretty similar;
   o  there is a maintained set of symbols of the "codec" where online
      Gaussian Elimination is performed.  But this same set, is used to
      also re-code packets for generation.  For this to work, one uses
      as pivot the highest index (instead of the lowest in standard
      RREF), in order to avoid adding symbols with higher indices in the
      decoding process.
   o  another set of differences would be that the protocol has more
      control over the coding process than our current codec proposal.
      The reason is that DRAGONCAST (re)codes for several neighbors, and
      in such scenario, there is no "obvious" decision that can be made,
      for instance:

      *  which source symbols (indices) should be present in a generated
         packet: -> tradeoff: helping the maximum number of nodes
         (emphasis on "new" undecoded source symbol indices) -vs-
         helping the neighbor which is the most late in the decoding
         process (emphasis on "old" source symbols)
      *  which symbols should be kept in the decoding process (or
         dropped): -> tradeoff: helping coding by keeping old symbols
         (be able to generate symbols for late neighbors) vs keeping up
         with decoding (and never throwing away a new symbol with high
         indices).  (I.  Amdouni discussed such issues in
         https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amdouni-nwcrg-cisew-00 for
         instance).
   o  In the current implementation, the packet generation process is
      done in the protocol which directly "peeks" in the set of symbols
      in the codec, and creates a linear combination with the ones that
      suits it.
   o  Technically the callbacks from the "codec" are:

      *  notification of a source symbol is decoded;

      *  notification that the set of symbols is full (protocol can
         remove symbols it sees fits, especially decoded symbols);
      *  for the "over-the-air" reflashing application, the codec can
         ask the protocol if an already removed source symbol is
         available (on the assumption that it has been written somewhere
         else);
