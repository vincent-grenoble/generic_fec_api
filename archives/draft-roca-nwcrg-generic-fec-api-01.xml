<t>
This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface (API) for sliding window FEC codes.
This API is meant to be compatible with any sliding window FEC code.
It defines the core procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e., implementation of the FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the responsibility of the application or protocol making use of the codec.
As a consequence, this is not an API for a FEC Scheme since certain mechanisms that must be defined by any FEC Scheme (e.g., signalling and FEC Payload IDs) are the responsibility of the caller instead of being addressed by the codec.
A goal of this document is to pave the way for a future open-source implementation of such codes, another goal is to simplify the development of content delivery protocols that rely on sliding window FEC codes for robust transmissions.

	<!-- ====================== -->

<t>
Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) codes are a key element of communication systems, used to efficiently recover from packet losses during content delivery sessions.
Among the FEC codes working at the network and higher layers, one can broadly distinguish block codes and sliding window codes.
Block FEC codes require the data flow coming from the application to be segmented into blocks of a predefined maximum size, before generating a certain number of repair packets.
With the second type of FEC codes, an encoding window continuously slides over the set of source data and repair packets are generated at any time by computing for instance a linear combination of data present in the encoding window.
This fondamental difference seriously impacts the way they can be used by a content delivery protocol or application.

This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface (API) for sliding window FEC codes.
This API is meant to be usable by any sliding window FEC code and FEC Scheme independently of the protocol that may rely on it.
This API defines the core procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e., implementation of the FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the responsibility of the application making use of the codec.

independently of the FEC Scheme or network coding protocol that may rely on it
This API defines the core procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e., implementation of the FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the responsibility of the application making use of the codec.
For instance, those restricted to end-to-end use-cases as well as those compatible with in-network re-encoding use-cases.
Additionaly, this API is not impacted by the intra-flow versus inter-flow nature of the use-case, nor is it impacted by the single-path versus multi-paths nature of the use-case, since those are usage considerations under the responsibility of the caller.

A goal of this document is to pave the way for a future open-source implementation of such codes.

	<section anchor="mechanismsConsidered" title="AL-FEC Codes and Mechanisms Considered by the Generic API">
	<!-- ====================== -->

<t>
This generic FEC API is meant to be used with:
<list style="symbols">
	<t>sliding window codes, that manage an encoding window (of fixed or variable size) that slides over the set of source symbols at the sender.
	On the opposite, block codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon, LDPC, Raptor(Q)) are out of scope; </t>

	<t>codes that are restricted to use-cases that involve a single encoding point and a single decoding point (i.e., FEC operations are carried out either within the end-hosts or middle-boxes), as well as codes that can be used with use-cases that involve in-network re-coding operations;</t>

	<t>use-cases that are limited to an intra-flow coding (simple case), as well as use-cases that involve inter-flow coding.
	This second case is more complex to address (e.g., with questions such as how to identify a packet of a flow?) however this is the responsibility of the application or protocol using this codec and not the codec itself.
	This aspect is therefore transparent to the API;</t>

	<t>use-cases that are limited to single-path communications and use-cases that consider multi-path communications.
	Here also this is a usage consideration that is transparent to the API;</t>

	<t>use-cases that involve a dynamic adaptation of the codec parameters (e.g., its code rate because the communication path losses is known thanks to feedbacks and an appropriate strategy can be defined);</t>

	<t>fixed code rate or not FEC codes, including rateless codes where the number of repair symbols that can be generated is huge (in theory illimited);</t>

	<t>ideal (MDS) or non ideal (non-MDS) codes. However most of the time, sliding window codes are non-ideal codes, meaning that slightly more than l repair symbols may be required to recover all the l lost source symbols;</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
A key question is to determine what mechanisms are included in the codec and what mechanisms are left to the responsibility of the caller (i.e., an application or a protocol making use of this codec).
More precisely, an FEC Scheme (such as the RLC FEC Scheme <xref target="RLC"/> in case of FECFRAME <xref target="fecframe-ext"/>) defines all the internal code details in order to enable interoperable implementations, but also signaling considerations that are essential to use them in a specific context.
</t>

		<section anchor="mechanismsConsideredOrIgnored" title="Mechanisms Considered or Ignored by the API">
		<!-- ====================== -->

<t>
Applying FEC in a given use-case to improve robustness involves many mechanisms.
However they are not all the responsibility of the codec and can be instead implemented within the application or protocol that uses the codec.
For instance the following mechanisms are considered out of scope of the API, being implemented by the caller, without any impact on the codec:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> code rate adjusment (e.g., thanks to communication path experienced loss feedback); </t>
	<t> signaling header creation / parsing (TBC, see discussion below); </t>
	<t> packet management; </t>
	<t> packet transmission / reception; </t>
	<t> tunnel management (if any); </t>
	<t> congestion control; </t>
	<t> selective ACK creation / parsing; </t>
	<t> memory management; </t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The following mechanisms are within scope of the API:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> session management (sender and receiver); </t>
	<t> encoding window management (sender and receiver): XXX: TO BE DISCUSSED; </t>
	<t> set/get/compute coding coefficient (sender and receiver); </t>
	<t> build coded symbol (sender); </t>
	<t> decode with received source or repair symbol (receiver); </t>
</list>
</t>

<!--
<t>
EDITOR NOTE: the following open questions remain:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> this document only focuses on sliding window codes. Do we all agree or should we extend it to block codes.
	Of course block codes can be regarded as a sliding window code with a fixed window, however if the API requires to list the source symbols and coefficients each time we receive a new repair, it will not be efficient at all.</t>

	<t> should the ADU to source symbols mapping be integrated into the codec or nor?
	This mechanism is FEC Scheme dependant and although useful to address variable size ADUs.
	This impacts the parameters when submitting a new source unit (i.e. is it an ADU or a symbol?) to the codec,
	and when a new source unit is available (notified in callbacks).
	This mechanism is also a source of extra complexity (essentially during decoding) because the unit of control and unit of transmission differ.
	The question is whether this should be hidden in the codec or managed by the application.
	Be careful, with RLC/FECFRAME there is also the FlowID of a decoded ADUI that is protected and should be returned to the caller if one decides to implement this feature within the codec.</t>

	<t> should the codec format the source/repair signaling headers/trailers associated to each symbol/packet as well?
	It could take the form of an additional buffer that is filled by the associated function.
	A benefit is that swaping between FEC schemes (for the same code or not) could be easier (no need to worrry about the packet headers).
	However this will also mean there is an instance per FEC scheme rather than FEC code (not a big deal).  </t>

	<t> from IETF 100 comment (Dave O.): is there any specificity to hardware codecs that should be considered here?
	What form could it take?</t>

	<t> There can be timing considerations (e.g., in a real time flow, a limited validity period.
	Should this be part of the API and codec, or is instead the codec agnostic of any timing aspect?
	Vincent: I think this should be addressed within the application.
	A consequence is that any source symbol that could be decoded should be, up to the application to decide whether to consider it or not. 
	Therefore there is a single notion within the codec, the maximum linear size (without any consideration of time), the other one, the decoding window (that considers time), being left to the appllication.
	This is the way our codec works and it's fine, but it leaves an extra responsibility to the application instead of hiding this level of complexity to the application.
	Of course this is also beneficial to flows having no timing requirements (no extra complexity).</t>
-->

<!--
			<t> How to identify a codec locally, within a library that would provide several FEC Schemes?
			For IETF standards, each "fully specified" FEC Scheme specified within the context of the RMT and FECFRAME WGs is already identified from their FEC Encoding ID in a dedicated IANA registry <eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/rmt-fec-parameters/rmt-fec-parameters.xhtml"/>.
			This IANA registry includes:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t> ietf:rmt:fec:encoding - Fully-Specified FEC schemes (FEC Encoding IDs 0-127); </t>
					<t> ietf:rmt:fec:encoding - Under-Specified FEC schemes (FEC Encoding IDs 128-255); </t>
					<t> FEC Framework (FECFRAME) FEC Encoding IDs (0-255); </t>
				</list>
			Only block codes are available in the context of RMT.
			With FECFRAME, in addition to block codes, two Sliding Window RLC FEC Schemes are being standardized and will be assigned FEC Encoding IDs 9 and 10.

			Experimental FEC Schemes, that have not been through an IETF standardization process, are not registered within the IANA registry.

<t>
For DRAGONCAST/DragonNet/GardiNet (<eref target="https://gitlab.inria.fr/GardiNet/liblc/"/>):
<list style="symbols">
<t> an API could be globally pretty similar; </t>

<t> there is a maintained set of symbols of the "codec" where online Gaussian Elimination is performed. But this same set, is used to also re-code packets for generation. For this to work, one uses as pivot the highest index (instead of the lowest in standard RREF), in order to avoid adding symbols with higher indices in the decoding process.  </t>

<t> another set of differences would be that the protocol has more control over the coding process than our current codec proposal.
  The reason is that DRAGONCAST (re)codes for several neighbors, and in such scenario, there is no "obvious" decision that can be made, for instance:
	<list style="symbols">
	<t> which source symbols (indices) should be present in a generated packet:
    -> tradeoff: helping the maximum number of nodes (emphasis on "new" undecoded source symbol indices) -vs- helping the neighbor which is the most late in the decoding process (emphasis on "old" source symbols)
	</t>
	<t> which symbols should be kept in the decoding process (or dropped):
   -> tradeoff: helping coding by keeping old symbols (be able to generate symbols for late neighbors) vs keeping up with decoding (and never throwing away a new symbol with high indices).
(I. Amdouni discussed such issues in <eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amdouni-nwcrg-cisew-00"/> for instance).
	</t>
	</list>
</t>

<t> In the current implementation, the packet generation process is done in the protocol which directly "peeks" in the set of symbols in the codec, and creates a linear combination with the ones that suits it.
</t>

<t> Technically the callbacks from the "codec" are:
	<list style="symbols">
	<t> notification of a source symbol is decoded;</t>
	<t> notification that the set of symbols is full (protocol can remove symbols it sees fits, especially decoded symbols); </t>
	<t> for the "over-the-air" reflashing application, the codec can ask the protocol if an already removed source symbol is available (on the assumption that it has been written somewhere else); </t>
	</list>
</t>
</list>
</t>
