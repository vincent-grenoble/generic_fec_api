<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) codes are a key element of communication systems, used to efficiently recover from packet losses during content delivery sessions.  Among the FEC codes working at the network and higher layers, one can broadly distinguish block codes and sliding window codes.  Block FEC codes require the data flow coming from the application to be segmented into blocks of a predefined maximum size, before generating a certain number of repair packets.  With the second type of FEC codes, an encoding window continuously slides over the set of source data and repair packets are generated at any time by computing for instance a linear combination of data present in the encoding window.  This fondamental difference seriously impacts the way they can be used by a content delivery protocol or application.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface (API) for sliding window FEC codes.  This API is meant to be usable by any sliding window FEC code and FEC Scheme independently of the protocol that may rely on it.  This API defines the core procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e., implementation of the FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the responsibility of the application making use of the codec.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This API is meant to be usable by any sliding window FEC code.  independently of the FEC Scheme or network coding protocol that may rely on it This API defines the core procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e., implementation of the FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the responsibility of the application making use of the codec.  For instance, those restricted to end-to-end use-cases as well as those compatible with in-network re-encoding use-cases.  Additionaly, this API is not impacted by the intra-flow versus inter-flow nature of the use-case, nor is it impacted by the single-path versus multi-paths nature of the use-case, since those are usage considerations under the responsibility of the caller.  </p>

More precisely, an FEC Scheme (such as the RLC FEC Scheme <a href="#RLC">[RLC]</a> in case of FECFRAME <a href="#fecframe-ext">[fecframe-ext]</a>) defines all the internal code details in order to enable interoperable implementations, but also signaling considerations that are essential to use them in a specific context.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">This section gathers functions used to manage the coding window, both at an encoder and at a decoder.  At an encoder a sliding (of fixed or elastic size) encoding window is managed. Whenever a repair symbol needs to be created, a linear combination (that is code specific) of source symbols currently in the encoding window is performed. This encoding window is managed with the functions below plus, potentially, internal mechanisms that are code specific.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">At a decoder, before submitting a new repair symbol to the codec, the application must specify the associated encoding window used at the source.

Once this coding window is ready, as well as the coding coefficient list if applicable, the application calls the decode_with_new_repair_symbol() function. A coding window may be reused for several repair symbols as long as they are all built from the same set of source symbols. In that case resetting the coding window and setting it from scratch would be a waste of time.

<p id="rfc.section.A.3.p.1">For DRAGONCAST/DragonNet/GardiNet (<a href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/GardiNet/liblc/">https://gitlab.inria.fr/GardiNet/liblc/</a>): </p>

<ul>
  <li>an API could be globally pretty similar; </li>
  <li>there is a maintained set of symbols of the "codec" where online Gaussian Elimination is performed. But this same set, is used to also re-code packets for generation. For this to work, one uses as pivot the highest index (instead of the lowest in standard RREF), in order to avoid adding symbols with higher indices in the decoding process.  </li>
  <li>another set of differences would be that the protocol has more control over the coding process than our current codec proposal.  The reason is that DRAGONCAST (re)codes for several neighbors, and in such scenario, there is no "obvious" decision that can be made, for instance: <ul><li>which source symbols (indices) should be present in a generated packet: -&gt; tradeoff: helping the maximum number of nodes (emphasis on "new" undecoded source symbol indices) -vs- helping the neighbor which is the most late in the decoding process (emphasis on "old" source symbols) </li><li>which symbols should be kept in the decoding process (or dropped): -&gt; tradeoff: helping coding by keeping old symbols (be able to generate symbols for late neighbors) vs keeping up with decoding (and never throwing away a new symbol with high indices).  (I. Amdouni discussed such issues in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amdouni-nwcrg-cisew-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amdouni-nwcrg-cisew-00</a> for instance).  </li></ul><p> </p></li>
  <li>In the current implementation, the packet generation process is done in the protocol which directly "peeks" in the set of symbols in the codec, and creates a linear combination with the ones that suits it.  </li>
  <li>Technically the callbacks from the "codec" are: <ul><li>notification of a source symbol is decoded;</li><li>notification that the set of symbols is full (protocol can remove symbols it sees fits, especially decoded symbols); </li><li>for the "over-the-air" reflashing application, the codec can ask the protocol if an already removed source symbol is available (on the assumption that it has been written somewhere else); </li></ul><p> </p></li>
