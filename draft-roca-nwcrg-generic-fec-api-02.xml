This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface (API) for sliding window FEC codes.
This API is meant to be compatible with any sliding window FEC code.
It defines the core procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e., implementation of the FEC code).
However, it leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the responsibility of the application or protocol making use of the codec.
As a consequence, this is not an API for a FEC Scheme since certain mechanisms that must be defined by any FEC Scheme (e.g., signalling and FEC Payload IDs) are the responsibility of the caller instead of being addressed by the codec.
A first goal of this document is to pave the way for a future open-source implementation of such codes, another goal is to simplify the development of content delivery protocols that rely on sliding window FEC codes for robust transmissions.

	<!-- ====================== -->

<t>
Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) codes are a key element of communication systems, used to efficiently recover from packet losses during content delivery sessions.
Among the FEC codes working at the network and higher layers, one can broadly distinguish block codes and sliding window codes.
Block FEC codes require the data flow coming from the application to be segmented into blocks of a predefined maximum size, before generating a certain number of repair packets.
With the second type of FEC codes, an encoding window continuously slides over the set of source data and repair packets are generated at any time by computing for instance a linear combination of data present in the encoding window.
This fondamental difference seriously impacts the way they can be used by a content delivery protocol or application.

This document introduces a generic Application Programming Interface (API) for sliding window FEC codes.
This API is meant to be usable by any sliding window FEC code and FEC Scheme independently of the protocol that may rely on it.

independently of the FEC Scheme or network coding protocol that may rely on it
This API defines the core procedures and functions meant to control the codec (i.e., implementation of the FEC code), but leaves out all upper layer aspects that are the responsibility of the application making use of the codec.
For instance, those restricted to end-to-end use-cases as well as those compatible with in-network re-encoding use-cases.
Additionaly, this API is not impacted by the intra-flow versus inter-flow nature of the use-case, nor is it impacted by the single-path versus multi-paths nature of the use-case, since those are usage considerations under the responsibility of the caller.

	<t>sliding window codes, that manage an encoding window (of fixed or variable size) that slides over the set of source symbols at the sender.

	<t>use-cases that are limited to an intra-flow coding (simple case), as well as use-cases that involve inter-flow coding.
	This second case is more complex to address (e.g., with questions such as how to identify a packet of a flow?) however this is the responsibility of the application or protocol using this codec and not the codec itself.
	This aspect is therefore transparent to the API;</t>

	<t>use-cases that are limited to single-path communications and use-cases that consider multi-path communications.
	Here also this is a usage consideration that is transparent to the API;</t>

	<t>use-cases that involve a dynamic adaptation of the codec parameters (e.g., its code rate because the communication path losses is known thanks to feedbacks and an appropriate strategy can be defined);</t>

	<t>fixed code rate or not FEC codes, including rateless codes where the number of repair symbols that can be generated is huge (in theory illimited);</t>

	<t>ideal (MDS) or non ideal (non-MDS) codes. However most of the time, sliding window codes are non-ideal codes, meaning that slightly more than l repair symbols may be required to recover all the l lost source symbols;</t>

<t>
A key question is to determine what mechanisms are included in the codec and what mechanisms are left to the responsibility of the caller (i.e., an application or a protocol making use of this codec) (<xref target="fig_codec_vs_fec_scheme_anc_protocol"/>).
More precisely, an FEC Scheme (such as the RLC FEC Scheme <xref target="RLC"/> in case of FECFRAME <xref target="fecframe-ext"/>) defines all the internal code details in order to enable interoperable implementations, but also signaling considerations that are essential to use them in a specific context.

		<!-- ====================== -->

<t>
Applying FEC coding, through an FEC Scheme, in a given protocol to improve transmission robustness involves many mechanisms.
However these mechanisms are not all the responsibility of the codec and can be implemented within the application or within the protocol that uses this FEC codec.
For instance the following mechanisms are considered **out of scope of the API**, being implemented by the caller, without any impact on the codec:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> memory management; </t>
	<t> packet transmission and reception; </t>
	<t> signaling header creation / parsing; </t>
	<t> ADU to source symbol mapping; </t>
	<t> code rate adjusment, for instance thanks to the knowledge of losses at a receiver via feedbacks; </t>
	<t> selective ACK creation and parsing; </t>
	<t> congestion control. </t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
The following mechanisms are **within scope of the API**:
<list style="symbols">
	<t> session management (sender and receiver); </t>
	<t> encoding window management (sender and receiver); </t>
	<t> set/get/generate coding coefficients (sender and receiver); </t>

<t>
This section gathers general definitions that are used by both an encoder and decoder.
</t>

<t>
About FEC Codepoints:
<list style="hanging">
<t> 
An application first needs to negotiate with its remote side the right FEC Scheme to use.
This negotiation usually relies on the FEC Encoding ID associated to this FEC Scheme for this application.
The FEC Encoding ID space, associated to an IANA registry, is protocol specific and the same value are usually
associated to different FEC Schemes depending on the protocol.
The FEC Encoding ID, from the Generic FEC API point of view, cannot be used to uniquely identify the codec.
</t>

<t>
The use of a codepoint to identify locally the right FEC codec requires that the application knows a
mapping between the FEC Encoding ID it uses and the local FEC Codepoints corresponding to available codecs.
This can be done at development time, after including the Generic FEC API header file, which gives access
to the ga_codepoint_t enumeration.

		<section title="Coding Window Functions at an Encoder and Decoder">
		<!-- ================ -->

<t>
This section gathers functions used to manage the coding window, both at an encoder and at a decoder.
At an encoder a sliding (of fixed or elastic size) encoding window is managed. Whenever a repair symbol needs to
be created, a linear combination (that is code specific) of source symbols currently in the encoding window is
performed. This encoding window is managed with the functions below plus, potentially, internal mechanisms that
are code specific.
</t>

<t>
At a decoder, before submitting a new repair symbol to the codec, the application must specify the associated
encoding window used at the source. This is done by the reset/add a single or set of symbols/remove a symbol functions.
Once this coding window is ready, as well as the coding coefficient list if applicable, the application calls
the decode_with_new_repair_symbol() function. A coding window may be reused for several repair symbols as long as
they are all built from the same set of source symbols. In that case resetting the coding window and setting it
from scratch would be a waste of time. The coding window must be viewed as a temporary list used solely by the
decode_with_new_repair_symbol() function and kept independant from the linear system managed by the codec.

		<section title="Coding Coefficients Functions at an Encoder and Decoder">

<t>
This section gathers functions used to manage the coding coefficients, both at an encoder and at a decoder.
Since different FEC codecs will have different requirements, it is important to keep these functions separate
from the build_repair_symbol() and decode_with_new_repair_symbol() functions.
Several situations exist:
<list style="symbols">
	<t>the application provides the list of coding coefficients to use for the next build_repair_symbol(); </t>
	<t>the application provides a key (typically a PRNG seed) that the codec uses to produce the coding coefficients to use for the next build_repair_symbol();</t>
	<t>the choice of the coding coefficients is totally performed by the codec, in an autonomous manner (e.g., the codec
	   includes an algorithm that produces an appropriate seed based on various criteria, or the codec selects a set of coding coefficients based on various criteria).

<t>
For DRAGONCAST/DragonNet/GardiNet (<eref target="https://gitlab.inria.fr/GardiNet/liblc/"/>):
<list style="symbols">
<t> an API could be globally pretty similar; </t>

<t> there is a maintained set of symbols of the "codec" where online Gaussian Elimination is performed. But this same set, is used to also re-code packets for generation. For this to work, one uses as pivot the highest index (instead of the lowest in standard RREF), in order to avoid adding symbols with higher indices in the decoding process.  </t>

<t> another set of differences would be that the protocol has more control over the coding process than our current codec proposal.
  The reason is that DRAGONCAST (re)codes for several neighbors, and in such scenario, there is no "obvious" decision that can be made, for instance:
	<list style="symbols">
	<t> which source symbols (indices) should be present in a generated packet:
    -> tradeoff: helping the maximum number of nodes (emphasis on "new" undecoded source symbol indices) -vs- helping the neighbor which is the most late in the decoding process (emphasis on "old" source symbols)
	</t>
	<t> which symbols should be kept in the decoding process (or dropped):
   -> tradeoff: helping coding by keeping old symbols (be able to generate symbols for late neighbors) vs keeping up with decoding (and never throwing away a new symbol with high indices).
(I. Amdouni discussed such issues in <eref target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amdouni-nwcrg-cisew-00"/> for instance).
	</t>
	</list>
</t>

<t> In the current implementation, the packet generation process is done in the protocol which directly "peeks" in the set of symbols in the codec, and creates a linear combination with the ones that suits it.
</t>

<t> Technically the callbacks from the "codec" are:
	<list style="symbols">
	<t> notification of a source symbol is decoded;</t>
	<t> notification that the set of symbols is full (protocol can remove symbols it sees fits, especially decoded symbols); </t>
	<t> for the "over-the-air" reflashing application, the codec can ask the protocol if an already removed source symbol is available (on the assumption that it has been written somewhere else); </t>
	</list>
</t>
</list>
</t>

/**

 *
 * This function requires that the application has previously set the coding window and the coding coefficients appropriately. 
 * After that, the application can call this function. The
 * application keeps a full control of the repair symbol buffer, i.e., the application is in charge
 * of freeing this buffer as soon as it believes appropriate to do so (a copy is kept by the codec).

 * This function usually returns OF_STATUS_OK, regardless of whether this new symbol enabled the
 * decoding of one or several source symbols, unless an error occurred. This function cannot return
